# ReTouch

ReTouch is an OpenGL application that enables editing and retouching of images using depth-maps in 2.5D. The depth maps are generated by [Volume](http://volume.gl), a state of the art tool, that uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to predict depth-maps from 2D images . ReTouch uses these depth-maps to enable the addition of depth of field and color retouching for the foreground and background separately.
